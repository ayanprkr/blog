import { Code } from 'astro/components';
import Link from "../../components/Link.astro";

It was late 2021s when I was first introduced to the Twitter API. 
Initially I tried making basic twitter bots which weren't much productive so I took a pause.
Later in 2022 when I was more motivated into programming and automation, I started learning many backend stuffs and started developing scripts.

There was one library known as <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/@napi-rs/canvas">@napi-rs/canvas</Link> or <Link href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/canvas">canvas</Link> which generates Image just from code!

OFC! it seems a cool library so I tried it. Initially, I was having a lot of issues working on it but later on it felt easy to use.

Later that day, I was brainstorming and then suddenly thought about a script which could fetch a random fact from an external API which will be then processed into an Image and uploaded to Twitter as the user's header.

I started working on the script/application using TypeScript cause why not? I started making a good program which would fetch the data from a random Quote API (<Link href="https://winterly-backend.herokuapp.com/">winterly-backend.herokuapp.com</Link>).

I made a class called `HeaderClient` which will have the essential functions and variables to get and return a quote

<Code
    code={`
    // src/utils/HeaderClient.ts

    class HeaderClient {
        out: WriteStream

        constructor(out) {
            this.out = out;
        };

        async getQuote(): Promise <QuoteData> {
            const res = await axios({
                method: "get",
                url: "https://winterly-backend.herokuapp.com/quote",
                responseType: "json"
            })  
            return res.data as QuoteData;
        }

        async renderHeader() {
            // working with canvas
        }
    }
    `}
    lang="ts"
    theme="material-ocean"
/>

In the above code, I have a constructor where the out stream will be stored when the object of the class is created in the Main file.
Inside the class, I have 2 main functions, one to get the quote and another one to render the image and save it to the out stream.

<Code 
    code={`
    // src/utils/HeaderClient.ts

    async renderHeader() {
        await registerFont("", { family: "myFont" });
        
        const data = await this.getQuote();
        
        const canvas = createCanvas(3000, 1000);
        const ctx = canvas.getContext("2d");

        ctx.font = "myFont";
        ctx.textAlign = "center";
        ctx.fillStyle = "#4A5568";
    }
    `}
    lang="ts"
    theme="material-ocean"
/>

These are some basic initializations in which it first registers an external font, gets the data using the `getQuote` function we created above, creates a canvas with width as 3000 and height as 1000 as twitter supports 3:1 aspect ratio for headers (you can also use 1500x500),creates a canvas with width as 3000 and height as 1000 as twitter supports 3:1 aspect ratio for headers (you can also use 1500x500), creates a 2D context.

Below the basic initializations, it assigns the stuffs to the context including the text alignment and the text's color.

<Code 
    code={`
    // src/utils/HeaderClient.ts

    async renderHeader() {
        // ...

        drawMultilineText(ctx, '"' + data.text + '" ~ ' + data.author, {
            rect: {
                x: 1500, 
                y: 400,
                width: canvas.width - 300,
                height: canvas.height - 100
            },
            font: "myFont",
            verbose: false,
            lineHeight: 1.4,
            minFontSize: 50,
            maxFontSize: 70
        })

        const stream = canvas.createJPEGStream()
        return stream.pipe(this.out);
    }
    `}
    lang="ts"
    theme="material-ocean"
/>

Here I'm using an external library <Link href="">canvas-multiline-text</Link> which generates a multi-lined text because the classic way sucks!

After the image generation, I create the canvas's stream (basically the image's type JPG/PNG) and then saving the image with the out stream we will be passing while we call the class in Main script.

<Code 
    code={`
    // src/intex.ts

    const twitter = new Twit({
        consumer_key: process.env.CONSUMER_KEY,
        consumer_secret: process.env.CONSUMER_SECRET,
        access_token: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN,
        access_token_secret: process.env.ACCESS_TOKEN_SECRET,
        timeout_ms: 60 * 1000,
        strictSSL: true,
    });

    const __filename = fileURLToPath(import.meta.url);
    const __dirname = path.dirname(__filename);
    const out = fs.createWriteStream(__dirname + "/out.jpg");

    const client = new HeaderClient(out);
    `}
    lang="ts"
    theme="material-ocean"
/>

Here I create the important variables required for the main script.

For the main script, we first need to create an Async function inside which it will first render the header.

<Code 
    code={`
    // src/intex.ts

    // ...

    (async () => {
        client.renderHeader();
    
        const fileToBase64String = fs.readFileSync(__dirname + "/out.jpg", {
            encoding: "base64"
        });

        twitter.post("media/upload", { media_data: fileToBase64String }, (err: any, data: any, res: any) => {
            let media_id = data.media_id_string;

            twitter.post("account/update_profile_banner", { media_id: media_id }, (err: any, data: any, res: any) => {
                if (err) return console.error(err);
                else console.log(chalk.green("Updated twitter header!!"));
            })
        })

    })();
    `}
    lang="ts"
    theme="material-ocean"
/>

To upload images by using Twitter API we need to first convert the image to a base64 string, after generating the b64 string we first upload the media to twitter using the `media/upload` endpoint of Twitter API V1.
It then returns a response which contains an ID of the uploaded image which we then use it to update our profile's banner using `account/update_profile_banner` endpoint.

This is it!
